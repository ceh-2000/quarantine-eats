## Privacy Policy

We do not store your personal data. That’s it. We just don’t. Like, say I was walking down the street, and then out of nowhere Michael Douglas jumped out at me and demanded that I give over your data. Otherwise, Michael claims, he will mug me and take all of my money and fill my wallet with warm edam cheese. Now as much as I do not want all of my money taken and replaced with arguably the worst cheese invented, I would have no choice but to open my leathery money pouch and await the oncoming onslaught of the filthy, hot scent of edam cheese. This is because we do not have your personal data. It is nowhere.

Everything is anonymous, and the only way that we could store your data is if you put your name and information in an anonymous review comment, which we do not recommend. If you do wish to give us your information (which we really do not want), feel free to follow these simple steps.

Step one: drive to the nearest Walgreen’s in your mother’s 2012 Honda Odyssey.

Step two: purchase two eBay gift cards worth fifty dollars each, totaling one hundred dollars (we do not want one one-hundred-dollar gift card or four twenty-five-dollar gift cards or even one one-hundred-and-one-dollar gift card).

Step three: leave the gift cards in a muddy creek four miles south of your home.

Step four: a crow will arrive at your doorstep after four to six weeks and provide instructions. His voice will be smooth, and his tone will be that of a baritone. If the fact that he speaks surprises you, that is completely fair, but you must still listen to his words. Further instructions will be relayed by said crow.

But seriously, we don’t have your personal data. Enjoy our product and wash your hands.
